ðŸ“„ Module1.sol - A Simple Solidity Contract for Error Handling

This is a simple Solidity contract that demonstrates error handling in Solidity using the `assert`, `revert`, and `require` statements.

Contract Overview
The `Checks` contract includes the following functionality:

1. A public variable `limit` that represents the maximum amount of Ether that can be transferred.
2. A `getBalance` function that retrieves the Ether balance of a given address.
3. An `error` definition called `singleTransferLimit` to handle a specific error condition.
4. A `transfer` function that allows transferring Ether to a specified receiver address.

Error Handling
`require()`
The `require()`statement is used to validate certain conditions before further execution of a function.

Example:
`require(<condition to be validated>, <message to be displayed if the condition fails>);`

`assert()`
The `assert()` statement is similar to` require()` and checks for conditions. If a condition fails, the function execution is terminated with an error message.

Example:

`assert(<condition to be checked/validated>);`

`revert()`
The `revert()` statement can be used to flag an error and revert the current call. It can also include a message providing details about the error, which will be passed back to the caller.

Using the Contract in Remix IDE
To use this contract in the Remix IDE, follow these steps:

1. Open the Remix IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new Solidity file and name it "Module1.sol".
3. Copy and paste the contract code into the "Module1.sol" file.
4. Select the appropriate Solidity compiler version (0.8.0 or higher) in the Remix IDE.
5. Compile the contract by clicking the "Compile" button.
6. Once compiled successfully, you can interact with the contract using the Remix IDE's built-in console or by deploying it to a test network.
Note: Before interacting with the contract, make sure you have a compatible Ethereum wallet connected to the Remix IDE (e.g., MetaMask).

Contract Functionality
`getBalance(address _address)`
The` getBalance` function allows you to retrieve the Ether balance of a given address. It takes an address as input and returns the balance as a uint256 value.

Example usage:

`uint256 balance = contractInstance.getBalance(address);`

`transfer(address payable _receiver)`
The `transfer` function enables transferring Ether to a specified receiver address. It requires a minimum value of 1 Ether to be sent. If the transfer amount exceeds the limit value (set to 10 Ether), the function reverts with an error message.

Example usage:

`contractInstance.transfer{value: 1 ether}(receiverAddress);`

Remember to replace` contractInstance` with the deployed instance of the contract and ` receiverAddress ` with the desired Ethereum address.
